# 1. Installations
This project uses Python 3 with Anaconda and Jupyter notebook.

# 2. Project Motivation
I am interested to answer three questions about developer trends by using Stack Overflow survey data from 2017.

The three questions are:
1. What programming language is mostly used by developers?
2. What type of developers participated in the survey?
3. How satisfied are developers in their career?

# 3. File Descriptions
- notebook.ipynb - The jupyter notebook that has the data analysis.
- survey_results_public.csv - StackOverflow Survey from 2017.
- survey_results_schema.csv - Description of the dataset columns.

# 4. Acknowledgements
Acknowledgements to Kaggle and Stackoverflow for providing the data.
